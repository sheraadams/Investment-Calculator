## Documentation

This is an Investment Calculator application. The program gets the opening amount, monthly deposit amount, years and interest from the user and with that information prints out two reports. The first report shows the year-end balances and year-end interest if no additional monthly deposits are made. The second report shows the year-end balances and year-end interest based on the monthly deposit value entered by the user. The application menu allows the user to enter calculate interest (one or more times) or exit the program.
