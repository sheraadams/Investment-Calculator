## Documentation

This is an Investment Calculator application. The program gets the opening amount, monthly deposit amount, years, and interest from the user.  The program provides two reports that compare the the year-end balance in the case that monthly deposits are made with the balance if no monthly deposits are made. The menu allows the user to enter multiple calculations or exit the program.
